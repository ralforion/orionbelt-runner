# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents working in this repository.

## Project Overview

**OrionBelt Runner** runs OBSL query batches and emits reports plus data exports. A run is a single YAML spec. Output today is markdown / HTML / PDF reports and Parquet / Arrow / TSV exports to a folder or S3; chart embedding is planned.

This repo **does not vendor OBSL**. All access goes through the public REST API of [orionbelt-semantic-layer](https://github.com/ralforion/orionbelt-semantic-layer) via a small `ObslClient` protocol (`src/orionbelt_runner/client.py`). When OBSL changes, only the HTTP client adapter needs to follow.

## Commands

```bash
uv sync                                                 # install
uv sync --extra arrow --extra pdf --extra dev           # + parquet/arrow/S3, PDF, test tooling
uv run orionbelt-runner run examples/monthly-revenue.yaml
uv run pytest                                           # tests
uv run ruff check src/ tests/                           # lint
uv run ruff format src/ tests/                          # format
uv run mypy src/                                        # type check
./scripts/check-action-pins.sh                          # after editing a workflow
```

```

**Anything about how OBSL answers belongs in `tests/obsl_stub.py`.** Every bug shipped in 0.8.0 was contract drift — the runner's models describing OBSL's responses slightly wrong, with hand-written fixtures encoding the same misunderstanding, so nothing failed until a real server answered. Pick the fixture that matches the layer:

- `stub_client` — a real `HttpObslClient` on a mock transport. No sockets. Default choice; covers params, headers, content-type negotiation, parsing.
- `stub_server` — the stub on a loopback port, for CLI-level runs.
- `obsl_stub` — the payload object itself; set `arrow_transport=False`, `warnings=[…]`, `columns=[…]` per test, and read `.requests` to assert how the runner called it.

When OBSL's contract changes, update `obsl_stub.py` **first** and let the failures show you what to fix. `test_stub_payloads_match_the_obsl_schemas` cross-checks the stub's field names (including pydantic aliases — OBSL sends `dataType` for `data_type`) against a sibling `../orionbelt-semantic-layer` checkout; it skips when the clone isn't there, so it guards a dev machine, not CI.

## Design rules

- **The Protocol is the seam.** Anything the runner needs from OBSL goes through `ObslClient`. Tests use a fake; a future in-process client lives next to `HttpObslClient` without touching `runner.py` / `report.py` / `cli.py`.
- **Pass query bodies through unchanged.** The runner does not parse or transform OBML queries — it forwards them to OBSL and treats the result as data.
- **Spec is the public contract.** Validate with Pydantic; keep `extra="forbid"` on `RunSpec` so typos surface early.
- **Reports are pure functions.** `render_markdown(spec, results, context)` takes the spec and the materialized rows; no I/O. The `Runner` is the only place that writes files.
- **Query results are data, never markup.** Cells and column names come from the warehouse, so anyone who can write a row writes into the report. `_format_cell` escapes everything markdown would read as markup — HTML, links and images, emphasis, and the block markers (heading, quote, list, rule) that are live where a value starts a line — and any new path that puts result text into a report must go through it. The spec (title, intro, footer, headings) is operator-written and stays live markdown. `render_pdf` refuses every external fetch as a second layer — the document is self-contained, so a URL that reaches WeasyPrint is never one the report needs.
- **Exports render to bytes, sinks own the write.** `render_export(result, fmt=…)` is pure; a `Sink` (folder or S3) is the only thing that touches a destination. New destinations (GCS, Azure) become new `Sink` implementations in `sinks.py` — `runner.py` must not learn about them.
- **Typed exports use the Arrow transport, and only pay for what's consumed.** Parquet / Arrow read via `execute_arrow()` (`?format=arrow`), whose table is written through untouched — never re-infer types the server already resolved. `build_arrow_table()` is the JSON fallback only. Note OBSL sends governed DECIMAL as *exact strings* in JSON, so the `decimal(p, s)` column hint must be honoured there; the report and TSV need the formatted run. `runner.run()` derives `needs_formatted` / `needs_raw` from the spec and executes each query once or twice accordingly — an export-only spec with only typed targets runs raw-only. Never format values client-side to fill this gap.
- **Exports and the run log never *destroy* a run, but they do report.** A failing target or raw re-execute is logged and skipped — a rendered report must survive an unreachable bucket — and lands in `RunResult.export_errors`, which the CLI turns into a non-zero exit. `succeeded` = every query ran; `fully_delivered` = that plus every export landed. Never write a typed export from formatted strings as a fallback: skip the query instead of silently changing the downstream schema.
- **Optional deps stay optional.** pyarrow (Parquet / Arrow / S3) and WeasyPrint (PDF) are imported inside the function that needs them, and the missing-dependency error names the extra to install. Core markdown / HTML / TSV runs must work on a bare `uv sync`.

## Conventions

- Python 3.12+, `from __future__ import annotations` everywhere
- Pydantic v2 for all I/O models
- Ruff: `["E", "F", "I", "N", "UP", "B", "A", "SIM"]`, line-length 100
- mypy strict mode with `pydantic.mypy` plugin
- structlog for logging — JSON-friendly when piped to a log collector

## OBSL version compatibility

The runner declares an OBSL **floor**, not an exact pairing: it runs against that release or anything newer, and is developed against the latest. `HttpObslClient.preflight()` calls the unauthenticated `GET /health` (which returns the OBSL release `version` and the active `auth_mode`) before any query. Below the floor raises `ObslVersionError`; above the newest tested minor logs `obsl_version_newer_than_tested` and proceeds; `ObslPreflightError` if the server enforces `AUTH_MODE=api_key` but no key was configured. The CLI runs preflight automatically (skippable with `--skip-preflight`, though that disables the auth check too).

The floor lives in `client.py` as `MINIMUM_OBSL_MAJOR` / `MINIMUM_OBSL_MINOR` — raise it only when the runner starts *depending* on something new, not every time OBSL ships a minor. `TESTED_OBSL_MAJOR` / `TESTED_OBSL_MINOR` record the newest minor exercised in CI and decide the warning wording only; bump them with the vendored schema when adopting a release. This replaced an exact-equality gate that pinned the runner to one OBSL minor and blocked any model written against a newer authoring surface until the runner cut a release of its own.

Note: `GET /v1/settings` also exposes `version` (release) plus `api_version` (the REST prefix, currently `"v1"` — *not* a semver). The runner still reads `settings()` mid-run to capture `version` / `api_version` into the run log, but the version *gate* is the `/health` preflight.

## Releasing

A release is a tag. `pyproject.toml`, `src/orionbelt_runner/__init__.py` and
`uv.lock` carry the version; bump all three, merge, then tag `vX.Y.Z` on `main`.
Pushing that tag fans out to three workflows: `docker-publish.yml` builds and
pushes `:X.Y.Z`, `:X.Y`, `:X` and `:latest`, `pypi-publish.yml` uploads the sdist
and wheel, and `release.yml` creates the GitHub Release and attaches
`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` and a CycloneDX SBOM to it. All three are tag-gated and
never fire on a branch push, and none depends on another having run.

`release.yml` is deliberately non-destructive. Releases here carry hand-written
titles and hand-written notes, so it rewrites neither: if a release for the tag
already exists it refreshes the two assets and touches nothing else, and it
composes notes itself only when there is no release at all. Create the release by
hand whenever you like, before or after the tag, and the assets still land on it.
To backfill a release cut before this workflow existed, download the two assets
from a later run and `gh release upload` them, since the workflow file does not
exist at the older tag.

It verifies rather than regenerates `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, exactly as CI does,
so the release ships the file the repository was reviewed with and a tag pushed
past a bypassed CI run fails instead of publishing a stale notice. The SBOM is
resolved the way the Dockerfile resolves it (3.14, `--no-dev --extra arrow
--extra pdf`), because the resolved set is interpreter-dependent and an SBOM
describing a dev environment would not describe the image anyone runs. Keep that
step in step with the Dockerfile's `uv sync` line.

The SBOM generator itself is pinned, `cyclonedx-bom==7.3.1` plus
`--exclude-newer`, for the same reason the Actions are: unpinned, the tool
describing what we shipped could change behaviour or break a release with no
commit behind it, and the version alone would leave cyclonedx-python-lib
floating. Both versions land in the SBOM's own `metadata.tools`, so a float
shows up as an unexplained diff between two releases of the same code. Nothing
bumps this automatically, since Dependabot reads manifests rather than `uvx
--from` inside a `run:` block, so move both values deliberately.

PyPI uses Trusted Publishing, so there is no token: the `pypi` GitHub
environment is what the identity binds to, and renaming it breaks the upload
until the publisher on PyPI is renamed to match. A manual run publishes the
current ref, which is how a version tagged before the workflow existed gets
uploaded — dispatch against `main` in that case, since the workflow file does not
exist at the older tag.

`pypi-publish.yml` is two jobs. `build` checks out the tree, verifies the tag
against both version strings, builds the sdist and wheel and runs `twine check`,
all with no `id-token`; `publish` downloads that artifact and uploads it, and is
the only job holding the identity PyPI accepts. The split is the security
boundary rather than a staging convenience: `uv build` invokes the build backend,
which resolves and executes whatever `pyproject.toml` names, and none of that
should be able to mint a token good for uploading this project. PyPI matches its
publisher on the workflow file and the environment, not the job, so `pypi` sits
on `publish` and the binding above is unaffected.

The version gate runs first, in `build`. That check exists because the drift has
happened: 0.9.0 sat in `pyproject.toml` through
several commits with no tag behind it, so v0.8.1 stayed the newest release while
two user-facing changes went unshipped. A tag that disagrees with what it
packages is worse than a missing one.

## Workflow Actions

Every Action the three workflows use is pinned to a commit SHA rather than a
version tag, because a tag is a movable label its owner can repoint at new code
at any time. A SHA is unreadable, though, so the `# vX.Y.Z` comment beside it is
the only part a reviewer actually reads, and nothing makes the two agree.

That gap is what `scripts/check-action-pins.sh` closes. It resolves each
comment's tag upstream with `git ls-remote` and fails when the SHA pinned in the
workflow is not the commit that tag names, so a hash quietly swapped for one
taken from a fork stops looking like a routine Dependabot bump — forks share
object storage with their parent, so such a commit is reachable under the real
repository's URL too, and only resolving the tag tells the two apart. It also
rejects any Action that is not SHA-pinned, any owner outside `ALLOWED_OWNERS`,
and any container action not pinned by digest, since an image tag such as
`:latest` moves just as a git tag does.

`ALLOWED_OWNERS` carries the most weight of the three. A SHA matching its own tag
says nothing about whether the Action belongs here, because a hostile
repository's tags verify against themselves perfectly well. Adding an owner is a
deliberate edit to the script, reviewed as such.

Comments must name exact patch releases. A major tag such as `v7` moves with
every upstream release, so checking against it would turn CI red the moment
`v7.0.2` ships for a pin that is still good, which is a dependency on exactly the
mutable pointer that pinning was meant to escape. To bump an Action, resolve the
release and paste both halves:

```bash
git ls-remote https://github.com/actions/checkout 'refs/tags/v7.0.1^{}'
```

In CI the check is a job of its own, `pins`, and every other job `needs:` it.
Running it beside them would be too late: a parallel job has already executed
its own `uses:` before `pins` can fail, so for a forged pin the attacker's code
runs anyway and the check is only blocking the merge, not the run. The same
reasoning puts it first after checkout in both publishing workflows, since those
hold the Docker Hub credentials and the PyPI identity, and an Action that has
already run could have rewritten the workspace, this script included.
`pypi-publish.yml`'s `publish` job needs no copy: it cannot start until `build`
has passed. `--offline` skips the upstream lookups and checks only SHA and
comment format.

**`pins` has to stay in `main`'s required status checks.** A job whose `needs:`
failed is reported as skipped, and branch protection counts a skipped required
check as satisfied. So if `pins` were dropped from the required list, a failing
pin check would skip `check`, `test` and `image` straight into a green merge,
which is worse than not gating them at all.

Permissions are scoped the same way. Each workflow declares `contents: read` at
the top, and the one job that needs more says so itself. Nothing here needs a
writable `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Docker Hub is authenticated by `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` and
PyPI by OIDC.

What this does **not** do, since a pin check is easy to over-trust: it does not
judge whether an Action is safe, only that the hash matches its own label; it
does not stop a downgrade to a real but ancient release; and `actions/checkout`
runs before the check and is therefore unverified, which is an irreducible
bootstrap dependency rather than an oversight.

## Third-party licenses

`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` is **generated** — edit `scripts/third_party_notices.py`,
never the file. It derives the closure from `uv.lock` (runtime + `arrow` + `pdf`;
`dev` is tooling the project runs, not a work it ships) and pulls each license text
from the wheel's own `*.dist-info/licenses/`, so the notice matches what is
installed rather than a hand-kept list.

Two scopes, kept distinct because conflating them makes the file claim things that
are not true: the *noticed* closure is everything the project can pull in, while
the *redistributed* set is only what the Dockerfile installs, parsed live by
`dockerfile_extras()` (comments dropped, continuations joined, `--extra=x` and
`--all-extras` / `--no-extra` handled — this is the seam the pyphen guard hangs
off, so it must not be defeated by reformatting a `RUN` line). Its dangerous
failure is an *empty* answer rather than a wrong one: nothing would be marked as
redistributed and the election check would not fire, while the notice still read
as verified. So an install command it does not understand raises instead — if you
change how the image installs, teach the parser first. Packages outside the image are still credited, marked
`no` in the summary, and described as informational. Install a new extra in the
image and the run fails until `NOTICED_EXTRAS` accounts for it.

The **Platform layer** section of that file covers what `uv.lock` cannot see — the
interpreter and the Debian userland the image inherits. It is prose in the
script's `PLATFORM_SECTION`, parameterised from the Dockerfile's
`FROM python:<version> AS runtime` line, so bumping the base image updates the
notice instead of silently invalidating it. Change that line's shape and
`runtime_base_image()` will fail loudly rather than emit a stale claim.

CI runs it with `--check`, which fails on drift **and** on any dependency whose
license is not permissive and not in the script's `ACKNOWLEDGED` map — where an
entry records the exact license expression that was reviewed, so a package that
relicenses fails rather than inheriting an approval granted to different terms. That gate is
the point: adding a copyleft dependency should be a decision someone writes down,
not something that arrives with a Dependabot bump. When it fires, either drop the
dependency or add an entry explaining why it is acceptable (see `certifi` and
`pyphen` for the shape). pyphen carries a second guard: it offers a choice of
three licenses, and choosing one only becomes necessary once we redistribute it.
The image installs `--extra pdf`, so it does, and `PYPHEN_ELECTION` records the
answer — **LGPL-2.1-or-later**, the arrangement for a library imported unmodified
from `site-packages`. `enforce_pyphen_election()` fails the build in both
directions: adding the extra without recording an election, and leaving an
election recorded after the extra is dropped. The second is not tidiness — the
elected wording states that the image hands over a copy of pyphen, so a stale
election puts a false sentence in a licence document.

A wheel that ships no license file gets a hand-vendored one in
`scripts/license-overrides/`, with its provenance recorded in the file. Anything
so vendored is called out in the notice as the only copy of those terms inside the
image, since the package's own `dist-info` carries none.

Apache-2.0 is the one license whose text repeats verbatim between packages — its
terms name no copyright holder — so `shared_apache_terms()` hoists that block into
**Appendix A** and the packages under it reference it instead of carrying ~10 KB
apiece. The split is on content, never on the declared license or the file name:
`apache_terms()` keeps a text only if it *opens* with the Apache-2.0 terms, because
pillow and fonttools bundle Apache-2.0 inside a larger collection and pyphen's GPL
and LGPL both end with the same `END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS` sentence — a looser
rule would hoist a block that is not those terms, or truncate a file that had more
to say. Whatever follows the terms in a given file (the APPENDIX example with the
holder filled in, pyarrow's ~100 KB of bundled notices) is still reproduced under
that package's own heading, so no text is dropped, only de-duplicated. A single
occurrence stays inline, and two byte-*different* Apache texts that each repeat is
a hard error rather than something to resolve: it would mean a dependency ships
altered terms, and folding those under one appendix heading would hide exactly the
fact worth seeing.

### What an acknowledgement has to say

`ACKNOWLEDGED` entries are prose because the useful ones are an argument, not a
label. The model to copy is the psycopg2 entry in `orionbelt-analytics`'s
`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, which names the specific clause it relies on (LGPL §5,
"works that use the library"), says why the obligation stops at the dependency and
does not reach BUSL-licensed code, states where complete corresponding source can
be obtained, records that the copy shipped is unmodified upstream and may be
replaced in place, and closes the obvious escape route by noting that psycopg 3
carries the same terms. An entry that only says "LGPL, dynamically linked, fine"
records a conclusion nobody can check.

`Pending` is the same field with the argument missing. It fails the gate exactly
as an unrecorded licence does; the difference is only that the error says somebody
has already looked. `--allow-pending` writes the notice anyway, with those packages
listed under a **⚠️ Unresolved licence questions** heading in the file itself, and
still exits non-zero — for standing this script up in a repository whose backlog is
the thing being surfaced, never for a release.

The notice answers the licence question, not the inventory one. For that the
pushed image carries an SBOM and max-detail build provenance as attestations
(`sbom: true` and `provenance: mode=max` in `docker-publish.yml`), so a consumer
can enumerate what is inside without unpacking the layers. The two are
generated by different means on purpose: the notice is derived from `uv.lock` by
a script in this repo and is committed, reviewable and diffable, while the SBOM
is produced by buildkit from the image it actually built. A disagreement between
them is a signal, not noise. Attestations live in the pushed index rather than
in the layers, so a plain `docker pull` by tag is unaffected; CI's `image` job
does not set them because it builds with `load: true`, and the docker driver
cannot load an index that carries them.

## Out of scope (for now)

- Scheduling — drive from cron / systemd / Cloud Scheduler / GitHub Actions
- Chart generation — landing later, likely via OrionBelt Analytics
- Multi-model session orchestration — supported via `model_id` only
- Non-S3 object stores (GCS, Azure) and partitioned / append-mode dataset writes — one file per query per target today
- Per-target query filtering — every target exports every query

When any of these arrive, keep them behind the same `ObslClient` boundary or add a sibling module — do not couple them into `runner.py` directly.
